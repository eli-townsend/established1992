              <p>
                As a lead designer for Old Dominion Freight Line, my team was tasked with modernizing the external website along with applications and to build everything on a responsive framework. Looking at the old website, the header was so busy that it felt impossible to find what you are looking for, the footer became a catch all for any link that needed to be on the site but did not require an entire page. Once my team dissected the old site, we began creating lo-fidelity mockups to present to the business which displayed a cleaner look for the header and footer along with different home/landing page layouts. As soon as we explained responsive design in detail, the business was on board with the direction that we were moving in. My team then created two hi-fidelity mockups for the business so that they could make the decision on which styles to create. We went through many iterations of design critiquing layout, changing color schemes and textures to business approval. ODFL.com was developed mobile first and simplified the process on numerous applications by removing steps to accomplish success criteria.
